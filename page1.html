                    Hey Vanicka, currently it is September 24th and it is 1:43 am. Right now we have plans to hang out pretty much all week and I’m so very excited I can't wait! We also have plans for me to come to your birthday which I'm happy you invited me to. However it did hurt me a little that you invited that Noah guy but nonetheless, if you’re reading this it means that it's over, and iv come to terms with the fact that we will not be together. Now I want to preface everything you’re about to read in the following pages with something. I have not made all of this in the mindset to guilt you, or to make you miss me, or to make you want to get back with me. Over the past weeks I have realized that my current words hold no more weight than the seeds of a dandelion that are flying away. I have learned that what I say cannot negate your feelings, and that no matter how hard I try, or what I do it will not necessarily make you love me and I have accepted this reality for what it is. I am making this as my final act of love for you. I am making this so I make sure I never leave any words unsaid, or any feelings I had or love I had for you on the table. I want to make sure I can say everything I’ve always felt, and how my deepest feelings for you and us have been. From the beginning of our relationship to now our current end. Whether you choose to read this whole website is something I won't ever necessarily know, however this website will preserve and stand from now until possibly even after I am gone. There's far too many things I want to say so I truly hope this encompasses the vast majority of my feelings. Whether you read this and feel something in your heart or read it with a blank face I am okay with either outcome as now I have come to terms with everything that I have been presented with. This website encompasses my entire being for you and it'll let you into my skin around my head and into my heart 
                    </p>
